ABSTRACT: Modern microscopes are increasingly becoming a primary producer of so-called
"Big Data".  While imaging techniques continue to raise the bar in resolution
and throughput, computing techniques for processing the resulting datasets
struggle to keep up.  For example, lightsheet microscopy today allows live 3D
imaging of entire developing embryos with high spatial and temporal
resolution, generating terabytes of data in a matter of a few hours.  It is 
essential to be able to access and handle these data efficiently for 
visualization and processing.

In the first part of this talk we look at the specific challenges of big image
data and review strategies for efficient storage and access, with a particular
focus on visualization and interactive exploration.  We then go on to discuss
the basic principles of volume ray casting, a technique to create volumetric 
image renderings which is (besides slicing) the predominantly desired mode of
visualization.
