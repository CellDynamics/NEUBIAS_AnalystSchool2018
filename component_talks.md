Deconstructing co-localisation workflows: from co-expression assessment to super-resolved co-distribution analysis
----------------------------------------


**Fabrice Cordelieres (Bordeaux Imaging Center)**

ABSTRACT: Co-localisation analysis is a one of the main interest of users entering a Facility with slides in hand and nice analysis perspectives in mind. While being available through most, if not all, analysis software, co-localisation tools are mainly perceived as black boxes, fed with images and excreting (the expected) numbers. A large bunch of papers have been trying to push forward one method which would perform better than all the others, losing the focus from the variety of biological problematics which may explain why so many methods exist nowadays.

In this talk, we will aim at deconstructing existing generic co-localisation workflows. By differentiating work-cases, identifying co-localisation reporters and the metrics others have been using, we aim at providing the audience with the elementary bricks and methods to build their really own co-localisation workflows

Big Data and 3D Visualization
----------------------------------------

**Tobias Pietzsch (MPI-CBG, Dresden)**

ABSTRACT: Modern microscopes are increasingly becoming a primary producer of so-called
"Big Data".  While imaging techniques continue to raise the bar in resolution
and throughput, computing techniques for processing the resulting datasets
struggle to keep up.  For example, lightsheet microscopy today allows live 3D
imaging of entire developing embryos with high spatial and temporal
resolution, generating terabytes of data in a matter of a few hours.  It is 
essential to be able to access and handle these data efficiently for 
visualization and processing.

In the first part of this talk we look at the specific challenges of big image
data and review strategies for efficient storage and access, with a particular
focus on visualization and interactive exploration.  We then go on to discuss
the basic principles of volume ray casting, a technique to create volumetric 
image renderings which is (besides slicing) the predominantly desired mode of
visualization.
