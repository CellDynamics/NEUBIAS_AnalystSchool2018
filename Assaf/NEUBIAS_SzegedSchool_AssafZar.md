## Abstract

From embryonic development, through synchronized beating of cardiac muscle cells to collective cell death - individual cells use basic cellular machinery to influence and respond to neighboring cells through a complex interplay of chemical and physical cues. How these local interactions are integrated in space and time to induce collective patterns is yet unknown. By designing and applying new analytical methods to migrating monolayers of epithelial cells, we discovered how local mechanical fluctuations induce long-range inter-cellular communication and identified potential molecular pathways driving this communication. 

A key in advancing this project was the ability to quantify spatiotemporal dynamics of a migrating monolayer. In the workshop, we will demonstrate two such methods and discuss how they were applied to learn new biology: (1) Explicit segmention of coordinated migrating cell clusters; (2) Spatiotemporal representation of the onset of monolayer migration;
